Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 


## Basic Visualization

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) for more info. In this visualisation, 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' was used as the JSON representation.. The URL of this JSON was used to pull in the data for our visualization.

The second dataset illustrates the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. This can be switched by the overlay option on the top right. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

In this step we have..

* Plotted a second data set on our map.

* Added a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
